My name is **Jithesh Chandrasekharan**.I am passionate about programming and have been working as a Software Engineer/Architect for more than a decade now.
I love what I do and hope you find this blog useful.  

**JMedium** (Jithesh's medium) is a programming journal, where I documents my experiments/experience with technologies using at work or for fun during my part time .

My recent focus in on data and cloud technologies, so expect more posts on that topic.
