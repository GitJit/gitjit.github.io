### About the Author

My name is Jithesh Chandrasekharan. I  live in  California where I’m working as a software consultant . I am passionate about programming and have been working as a Software Engineer/Architect for more than a decade now.I love what I do and hope you find this blog useful.  

This blog is mainly about my latest experiences or experiments with some technologies, I’m using at work or for fun during my part time . My recent focus in on Big Data technologies, so expect more posts on that topic. 
 
My favorite form of communication is Twitter, where you'll find me ranting 140 characters at a time at [@jitheshmenon](https://twitter.com/jitheshmenon "my twitter profile").
