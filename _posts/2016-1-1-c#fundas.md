During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system 
called Simple Managed C (SMC).[11][12] In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool,
 which stood for "C-like Object Oriented Language".[13] Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, 
 but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 
 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.

C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft is Anders Hejlsberg, who was previously involved with the design of Turbo Pascal,
 Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers he 
 has stated that flaws[citation needed] in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the
  fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language itself.
