## IP Subnetting  
IP addresses uniquely identify a device in a network.  IP addresses can be classified as public IP or Private IP. IP addresses discoverable on the internet are called Public IP addresses. Public IP's are globally unique, while private IP is unique within a network. Private IP's are usually assigned to devices in a home/office network.
