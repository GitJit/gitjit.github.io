My name is Jithesh Chandrasekharan. I  live in  Colorado  where I’m working as a software consultant . I am passionate about programming and have been working as a Software Engineer for more than a decade now. For the past 3 years, I have been working in big data technologies.

This blog is mainly about my latest experiences or experiments with some technologies I’m using at work or for fun during my part time .  In particular, I’m a big fan of hadoop and its ecosystem so I started  a series of tutorials around it.

To get in touch, [send me an email](mailto: {{ site.email }}).
