My name is Jithesh Chandrasekharan. I  live in  Colorado  where I’m working as a software consultant . I am passionate about programming and have been working as a Software Engineer for more than a decade now. 

This blog is mainly about my latest experiences or experiments with some technologies I’m using at work or for fun during my part time . My recent focus in on Big Data technologies, so expect more posts on that topic.

To get in touch, [send me an email](mailto: {{ site.email }}).
